I want to give a big shoutout to Vbe0201's [Simple Discord Music Bot](https://gist.github.com/vbe0201/ade9b80f2d3b64643d854938d40a0a2d)
I got some of the underlying functionality from this, however, the majority of this project is created by myself.
Note: If you use this project please reference both.

# Features :+1:

This bot has some cool features such as:
- The ability to create and play playlists.
- Generic song lookup using keywords
- In-app storage to maintain your liked songs and playlists
- Full-featured reaction music player including ff, play, skip, loop, pause, shuffle, and like.
- View saved playlists and directly play a song by reacting to it's line number.
- Excellent audio quality
- Audio priority queue meaning selected songs have the option to be placed at the front of the queue.
